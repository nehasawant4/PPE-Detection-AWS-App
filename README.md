In industries like construction, manufacturing, and healthcare, employees work in potentially hazardous environments. This increases the likelihood of workplace accidents due to the inherent risks. A key strategy for mitigating these risks is ensuring compliance with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) protocols.

The PPE Detection Application has been developed to detect the use of PPE and monitor its adherence within custom building premises.
